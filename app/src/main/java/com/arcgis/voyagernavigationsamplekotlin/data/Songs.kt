            description = "Radiohead have been called the Beatles true heirs, a group advancing in such leaps and bounds that their contemporaries are trailing in their wake. For a reputation and status like that you would expect a group to be something out of the ordinary. The band formed when Thom Yorke,  Johnny Greenwood, Ed O Brien, Colin Greenwood and Phil Selway attended a private boys school near Abingdon, near Oxford, UK, broke up whilst they attended University and reformed in 1991 when they signed a recording deal with Parlophone.<br /><br />The band broke in the USA before having UK success. This enabled them to build up a legion of followers who could associate with their music, songs and lyrics. Their third album, in the UK, \"OK Computer\" propelled them to international stardom and by 2007 Radiohead had sold in excess of 25 million albums. This is not a music release by the artist or record label and sound qualilty may vary. In this exclusive audiobiography we hear how fame almost caused them to split up, what inspires them in their writing, the relationship they have with their fans and the message they want to give to the world and to then music is the best artform to explain their opinion of society. Fans, music historians and collectors will get a unique insight into Radiohead."
